We define a route for the root URL (\"/\") using the `app.get()` method. When a user accesses the root URL, the callback function `(req, res) => { ... }` is executed. Inside this function, we use the `res.send()` method to send the \"Hello, World!\" message as the response to the user's request.\n\nFinally, we call the `app.listen()` method to start the server and make our web application available on port 5000. The callback function `() => console.log('Example app listening on port 5000')` is optional and simply logs a message to the console to indicate that the application is running.\n\nYou can now run this code in a Node.js environment and access the web application by visiting `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.",

He is a founding member of Depeche Mode and has written the majority of their songs. His work now spans over four decades. Gore's best-known compositions include hits such as \"Personal Jesus\", \"Enjoy the Silence\", \"Stripped\", \"It's No Good\", \"In Your Room\", \"Strangelove\", \"I Feel You\", \"People Are People\", \"Precious\", \"A Question of Time\", \"Policy of Truth\", \"Everything Counts\", \"Behind the Wheel\", \"Shake the Disease\", \"Never Let Me Down Again\" and many more.  - Vince Clarke (born Vincent John Martin; 3 July 1960) is an English synthpop musician and songwriter. Clarke has been the main composer and musician of the band Erasure since 1985, and was previously the main songwriter of several groups, including Depeche Mode, Yazoo and The Assembly.  - \"A Question of Lust\" is Depeche Mode's sixteenth UK single, released on 14 April 1986.  - Depeche Mode are an English electronic music band that formed in 1980 in Basildon, Essex. The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, main songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards), and Vince Clarke (keyboards, main songwriter from 1980 to 1981). Depeche Mode released their debut album in 1981, \"Speak & Spell\", bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Clarke left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record \"A Broken Frame\", released the following year. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next thirteen years.

The `length` variable is used to store the total number of elements in the array by dividing the size of the array by the size of a single element.\n\nNext, we use a for loop to iterate over each element of the array. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 0 and continues as long as `i` is less than the `length`. On each iteration, the code inside the loop body is executed.\n\nInside the loop, we use `printf` to print the value of `arr[i]`, followed by a space. This way, each element is printed on the same line with a space separating them.\n\nAfter the loop finishes, the program exits and returns 0.\n\nI hope this helps!
