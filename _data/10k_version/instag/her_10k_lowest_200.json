    "instruction": "BEGININPUT\nIt was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn, and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.\nThe wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.\nI had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly, and not relax the impending conflict until my own life, or that of my adversary, were extinguished.\nElizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence; at length she said, \"What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?\"\n\"Oh! peace, peace, my love,\" replied I, \"this night, and all will be safe: but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.\"\nI passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how dreadful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.\nShe left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house, and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him, and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins, and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.\nGreat God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope, and the purest creature of earth. She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down, and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Every where I turn I see the same figure--her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this, and live? Alas! life is obstinate, and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fainted.\nWhen I recovered, I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her; and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm, and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her, and embraced her with ardour; but the deathly languor and coldness of the limbs told me, that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.\nWhile I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The windows of the room had before been darkened; and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, shot; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and, running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.\nThe report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.\nI did not accompany them; I was exhausted: a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I lay on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek something that I had lost.\nAt length I remembered that my father would anxiously expect the return of Elizabeth and myself, and that I must return alone. This reflection brought tears into my eyes, and I wept for a long time; but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting on my misfortunes, and their cause. I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder, and recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\nThere were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row, and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured, rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar; and, leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine, or the clouds might lour; but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness: no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.\nBut why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event. Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.\nI arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived; but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight--his niece, his more than daughter, whom he doated on with all that affection which a man feels, who, in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs, and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; an apoplectic fit was brought on, and in a few days he died in my arms.\nWhat then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth; but awoke, and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation, and was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad; and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\nBut liberty had been a useless gift to me had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause--the monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.\nNor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.\nThe magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness: \"Be assured, sir,\" said he, \"no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.\"\n\"I thank you,\" replied I; \"listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange, that I should fear you would not credit it, were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.\" My manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death; and this purpose quieted my agony, and provisionally reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly, but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy, and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\nThe magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.\nWhen I had concluded my narration, I said. \"This is the being whom I accuse, and for whose detection and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.\"\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, \"I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and dens, where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered, or what region he may now inhabit.\"\n\"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not credit my narrative, and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.\"\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated; \"You are mistaken,\" said he, \"I will exert myself; and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable, and that, while every proper measure is pursued, you should endeavour to make up your mind to disappointment.\"\n\"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand: I have but one resource; and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.\"\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a phrenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness, which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\n\"Man,\" I cried, \"how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.\"\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 190 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION",

    "instruction": "BEGININPUT\nXVIII. Nine Days\nThe marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom.\n\"And so,\" said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; \"and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!\"\n\"You didn't mean it,\" remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, \"and therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!\"\n\"Really? Well; but don't cry,\" said the gentle Mr. Lorry.\n\"I am not crying,\" said Miss Pross; \"_you_ are.\"\n\"I, my Pross?\" (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.)\n\"You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into anybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection,\" said Miss Pross, \"that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till I couldn't see it.\"\n\"I am highly gratified,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"though, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!\"\n\"Not at all!\" From Miss Pross.\n\"You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?\" asked the gentleman of that name.\n\"Pooh!\" rejoined Miss Pross; \"you were a bachelor in your cradle.\"\n\"Well!\" observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, \"that seems probable, too.\"\n\"And you were cut out for a bachelor,\" pursued Miss Pross, \"before you were put in your cradle.\"\n\"Then, I think,\" said Mr. Lorry, \"that I was very unhandsomely dealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,\" drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, \"I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear Somebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his own.\"\nFor a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.\nThe door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face. But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind.\nHe gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.\nBesides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling, glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting.\nIt was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, \"Take her, Charles! She is yours!\"\nAnd her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was gone.\nThe corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow.\nHe had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.\n\"I think,\" he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, \"I think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him. I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well.\"\nIt was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of Tellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.\n\"Good God!\" he said, with a start. \"What's that?\"\nMiss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. \"O me, O me! All is lost!\" cried she, wringing her hands. \"What is to be told to Ladybird? He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!\"\nMr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy.\n\"Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\"\nThe Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.\nHe had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.\nMr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was.\n\"A young lady's walking shoe,\" he muttered, without looking up. \"It ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.\"\n\"But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\"\nHe obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work.\n\"You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper occupation. Think, dear friend!\"\nNothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.\nTwo things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post.\nThese measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he thought the best, on the Doctor's case.\nIn the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same room.\nHe was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.\nDoctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write. When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose and said to him:\n\"Will you go out?\"\nHe looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner, looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:\n\"Out?\"\n\"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?\"\nHe made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr. Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in some misty way asking himself, \"Why not?\" The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.\nMiss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his bench and to work.\nOn this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name, and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.\nWhen it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:\n\"Dear Doctor, will you go out?\"\nAs before, he repeated, \"Out?\"\n\"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?\"\nThis time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he slipped away to his bench.\nThe time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day. The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days.\nWith a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening.\nENDINPUT\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nSummarize the input in around 140 words.\nENDINSTRUCTION",

    "output": "\"The Godfather\" is an American crime film released in 1972, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Mario Puzo. The story takes place from 1945 to 1955 and follows the fictional Corleone family, a powerful and respected Italian-American Mafia clan operating in New York City.\n\nThe film opens with a wedding scene, as the daughter of the Godfather, Vito Corleone, is getting married. During the wedding, Vito is approached by a rival gangster, Sollozzo, who requests his support in the drug trade. Vito refuses, setting off a series of events that lead to attempts on his life.\n\nAfter Vito is shot and nearly killed, his youngest son, Michael, steps up to take revenge against those who harmed his father. Michael proves to be calculating and ruthless, taking over the family business and becoming the new Godfather. He consolidates power and eliminates his rivals, solidifying the Corleone family\u2019s status as a dominant force in the criminal underworld.\n\nThe film concludes with a montage of scenes showing the outcome of Michael's actions, as he lies to his wife about his criminal activity and becomes more and more engulfed in the world of the Mafia. The final shot shows the door closing as Michael is left alone, isolated in his new role as the Godfather.\n\n\"The Godfather\" is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and a landmark achievement in the gangster genre, revered for its complex characters, rich storytelling, and examination of the American Dream as seen through the eyes of a criminal dynasty.",

However, we need to divide this by 2 because each handshake is counted twice (once for each person involved).\n3. Therefore, the total number of handshakes can be represented as: n(n-1)/2\n4. We know there were 66 handshakes, so we set up the equation: 66 = n(n-1)/2\n5. Solving for n, we get: n^2 - n - 132 = 0\n6. Factoring this quadratic equation, we find that (n-12)(n+11) = 0\n7.

I'll also put a decimal point above the quotient, aligned with the decimal point in the dividend. How many times does 20 go into 3? It doesn't, so I'll put a zero above the 3. Next, I'll bring down the first zero after the decimal point. How many times does 20 go into 30? It goes once, with a remainder of 10.

This makes it easier to control access to the data and to maintain and modify the code.\n\n2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details from the user, giving them only the information that is relevant. This is achieved by creating abstract classes and interfaces, which define the common interface for the objects that implement them, without revealing the underlying implementation details.\n\n3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes from existing ones, by inheriting the attributes and behavior of the parent class. This allows for code reusability and makes it easier to create and maintain complex applications.\n\n4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of different objects to be treated as instances of the same class, even if their actual classes are different. This allows for a more flexible and dynamic design, as the code can work with objects of different types, without knowing their exact type at runtime.",

Let's assume the age of the mother is M and the age of the father is F. Since the father is twice as old as the mother, we can write it as F = 2M.\n3. Now, let's represent the ages of the four children as C1, C2, C3, and C4.\n4. According to the information given, the sum of all their ages is 120 years. So, we have the equation: M + F + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = 120.\n5. We already know that F = 2M, so we can substitute this into our equation: M + 2M + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = 120.\n6. Simplifying the equation gives us: 3M + (C1 + C2 + C3 + C4) = 120.\n7. At this point, we don't have enough information about the individual ages of the children to solve for them directly. However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that the total age is 120 years and there are 6 family members.\n8. Considering that the father is twice as old as the mother, and assuming the children have reasonable ages, we can deduce that the mother must be younger than 40 years old (otherwise, the father would be at least 80, which seems unlikely with young children).\n9. If we test the possibility of the mother being 30 years old, then the father would be 60 years old (2 * 30). This would leave 30 years to be distributed among the four children.\n10. Since this distribution seems reasonable and fits within the constraints given in the question, we can conclude that the mother is 30 years old.",

It is a simple 2D table tennis simulation where two players control paddles on either side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The impact of Pong on the gaming industry was significant as it introduced the concept of electronic games to a wide audience, leading to the growth of the arcade gaming culture. Additionally, Pong's success paved the way for other early video game companies to enter the market and develop new games.\n\n2. Space Invaders (1978): Created by Tomohiro Nishikado and released by Taito, Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and an icon of the golden age of arcade games. Players control a laser cannon that moves horizontally across the bottom of the screen, firing at descending rows of aliens who move left to right and gradually approach the player. The game popularized several key concepts in video gaming, such as high scores, multiple lives, and enemy movement patterns. Space Invaders had a massive impact on the gaming industry, driving the demand for more complex and challenging games, inspiring numerous sequels and clones, and contributing to the rise of the shoot 'em up genre.\n\n3. Pac-Man (1980): Developed by Namco, Pac-Man is another iconic arcade game that has become synonymous with the golden age of arcade gaming. In this maze-based game, players control a yellow character named Pac-Man as he navigates through a maze filled with dots while avoiding four ghosts. The goal is to eat all the dots without being caught by the ghosts. Pac-Man was revolutionary in its non-violent gameplay and appeal to both male and female audiences, which broadened the demographic reach of video games. Its impact on the gaming industry can be seen in the countless spin-offs, merchandise, and adaptations it inspired, as well as its influence on game design principles such as level progression, power-ups, and character-based gameplay.",
